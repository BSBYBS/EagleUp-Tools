Add-on Tools for EagleUp https://eagleup.wordpress.com/

Tool #1
The premise of the EagleUp Model Attribute Tool is to allow users a single interface for adding or updating model name attributes to the board file.  It looks at the Model Path directory set by EagleUp_export and allows the user to traverse the directory tree, select a Model and assign it to the EAGLEUP Attribute. This utility can be run completely stand-a-lone as long as eagleup has been initialized. 

Tool #2
EagleUp Model Export - This tool will allow to create a new component model(s) in SketchUp on top of any existing board created by EagleUp then export that model name(s) back into the eagle board file.  This tool is still in an alpha state.
